Facial recognition is the fast growing and challenging field in biometric applications. Variety of improvements has been suggested considering the feature extraction and matching techniques for accurate and efficient facial recognition. In this paper we proposed an approach which uses facial recognition methodologies to implement a computational efficient technique for facial biometric application to help visually impaired people. In this system we used LBP for feature extraction to classify image either valid or invalid person using SVM classification so that it helps visual impaired people in improving their lifestyle and safety. The architecture has been verified with both in a real environment Actual users and printed images have achieved very good results.
Use neural network for online mode and SVM  for offline mode
